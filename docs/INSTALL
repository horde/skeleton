This document contains instructions for installing the Skeleton ...

For information on the capabilities and features of Skeleton, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Skeleton distribution.


Obtaining Skeleton
==================

Skeleton can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/skeleton/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/skeleton/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of Skeleton are available via Git; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution, or the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde Git
repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Skeleton **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Skeleton runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must install Horde before
   installing Skeleton.

   .. Important:: Skeleton 1.0 requires version 4.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Skeleton. Many of Skeleton's prerequisites are
                  also Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Skeleton's
                  optional features are configured via the Horde install.

2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. FOO support ``--with-foo`` [OPTIONAL]

      Description of Foo and what it is used for.

3. The following PEAR packages:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR packages)

   a. PEAR_Package x.x.x [OPTIONAL]

      Skeleton uses the Foo_Bar class for...

4. The following PECL modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PECL modules)

   a. pecl_package x.x.x [OPTIONAL]

      pecl_package is required to...


The following items are not required, but are strongly **RECOMMENDED**:

1. Yet something else.


Installing Skeleton
===================

Skeleton is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from system to
system. Conventionally, Skeleton is installed directly underneath Horde in the
web server's document tree.

Since Skeleton is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL. For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/skeleton-h3-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv skeleton-h3-x.y.z skeleton

and would then find Skeleton at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/skeleton/


Configuring Skeleton
====================

1. Configuring Horde for Skeleton

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['skeleton']``
      stanza. The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired. If you have changed the location of Skeleton relative
      to Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update
      the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Creating the database tables

   The specific steps to create Skeleton's database tables depend on which
   database you've chosen to use.

   First, look in ``scripts/sql/`` to see if a script already exists for your
   database type. If so, you should be able to simply execute that script as
   superuser in your database. (Note that executing the script as the "horde"
   user will probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using the
   file ``skeleton.sql`` as a starting point.  If you need assistance in
   creating database tables, you may wish to let us know on the Skeleton
   mailing list.

   You will also need to make sure that the "horde" user in your database has
   table-creation privileges, so that the tables that `PEAR DB`_ uses to
   provide portable sequences can be created.

   .. _`PEAR DB`: http://pear.php.net/DB

3. Configuring Skeleton

   To configure Skeleton, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Or on Windows::

      copy *.dist *.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in each
   file. You may edit these files if you wish to customize Skeleton's
   appearance and behavior. With one exception (``foo.php``) the defaults will
   be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Skeleton. Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to
   get to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration``
   icon to get the configuration page. Select ``Skeleton Name`` from the
   selection list of applications. Fill in or change any configuration values
   as needed. When done click on ``Generate Skeleton Name Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file. If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Skeleton configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file. In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``skeleton/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Skeleton uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory. If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

4. More instructions, upgrading, securing, etc.

5. Testing Skeleton

   Once you have configured Skeleton, bring up the included test page in your
   Web browser to ensure that all necessary prerequisites have been met. See
   the `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ document for further details on Horde test
   scripts. If you installed Skeleton as described above, the URL to the test
   page would be::

      http://your-server/horde/skeleton/test.php

   The test script will also allow you to test...

   Next, use Skeleton to.... Test at least the following:

   - Foo
   - Bar
